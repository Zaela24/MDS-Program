# Background
This is the translation of a program originally written in Matlab.

What this program does is bring up a screen where users rate the difference between two colors on a numeric scale.

There are two different versions -- one is an abridged scale with only adjacent and one-over adjacent pairs, the other is a full comparison of each color against every other color in the full set.

This is part of ongoing research at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities involving an attempt to validate an abridged version of Multi-Dimensional Scaling.

## How to use
You will need [PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org/download.html) to run this. At the start, you will need to enter a participant number into the python console (any integer will work), then you'll need to choose monitor out of the selections (the patches version is for in person versions proctored by research assistants), then you can choose full or adjacent (I'd strongly recommend choosing adjacent as it only takes a few minutes to complete, whereas the full version takes nearly a half-hour to complete).

## Important note
Due to Covid-19 we cannot access the physical Munsell chips nor spectrometers that are in the lab, thus not all colors are currently loaded into the list and some are a neutral placeholder.
